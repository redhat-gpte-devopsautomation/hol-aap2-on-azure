. Click on the *Create* button.  You will now need to provide additional details before we can initiate the deployment process.
    * *Subscription*:  You will only have access to one subscription and it will be selected by default.
    * *Resource Group*:  Select the *Create New* link and provide a name.  Use something like your *Initials-rg*
    * *Region*:  Please leverage one of the TWO following indicated regions.  They have been set up with additional resource quotas to support this lab/demo environment.

    ** East US
    ** Germany West Central


    * *Application Name*:  You can stick with the default or rename it.  Minimum 10 AlphaNumeric characters only
    * *Administrator Password*: This is the AAP Controller / Private Automation Hub admin password.  Minimum 12 characters.
    * *Access*:  Public access policy exposes Ansible Automation Platform UIs to incoming traffic from the Internet for faster deployment. Private access policy requires that you peer Azure virtual networks to access Ansible Automation Platform UIs.  For this lab / demo, please use PUBLIC.
    * *Managed Resource Group*:  This is the resource group that Red Hat SREs will have access to in order to manage the lifecycle of the managed application.  You can safely keep this auto generated name unchanged

. The deployment can take from 60 minutes to 90 minutes.

[NOTE]
At times during deployment you may experience what Microsoft refers to as “Transient Errors''.  These transient errors cause the deployment of AAP to fail.  You MUST delete the AAP Managed Application resource from the resource group, and wait until the 2 other associated resource groups are also deleted.  Once everything has been deleted, then please attempt to deploy AAP on Azure again.  There’s a good chance you may have to deploy this 2 or 3 times to get it to succeed.  Please be patient.
