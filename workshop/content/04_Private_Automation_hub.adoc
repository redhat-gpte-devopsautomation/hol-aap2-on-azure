The content will synchronize successfully and be available in the Private Automation Hub.

==== Synchronize Red Hat Certified Ansible content

. Log in to the Private Automation Hub UI.  Use admin for the username, and the Administrator Password you supplied when you deployed the AAP application.  If you don’t have the URL, please copy it from the Azure AAP application on the *Parameters and OutPuts* page.  Look for *automationHubUrl*.
. Expand the *Collections* menu on the left, and then select *Collections*, adjust the *Filter by repository* to *Red Hat Certified* and notice you have NO content there.

==== Add Remote Registries in Private Automation Hub

Private Automation Hub can also be the registry for any Execution Environments you may want to use.  This way the Controller won’t have to pull them from the internet, but from Private Automation Hub.  Let’s show how to add a remote registry in Private Automation Hub, and then how to add an Execution Environment.

. Expand *Execution Environments* and select *Remote Registries*
. Select *Add remote registry*, and fill in details similar to the image below with your information. *(URL: https://quay.io)*
. If you have any private Repos there with custom Execution Environments, you can synchronize them now.

+
image::./images/image9.png[titele="image9",500,float=".left.text-center",align="center"]
. For public Repos you don’t need the registry credentials, they can be left blank. *Add another registry for public images from quay.io (URL: https://quay.io)*
+
image::./images/image38.png[titele="image38",500,float=".left.text-center",align="center"]
+
image::./images/image15.png[titele="image15",500,float=".left.text-center",align="center"]
. Now let’s pull in an Execution Environment image, into Private Automation Hub.
. Expand *Execution Environments* and select *Execution Environments*
. Select *Add execution environment*, and fill in details similar to the image below.
. *Name*:  another-azure-ee
. *Upstream name*:  scottharwell/azure-execution-env
. *Registry*: From the drop down select  quay.io
. *Add tag*:  latest
. *Save*.
+
image::./images/image43.png[titele="image43",500,float=".left.text-center",align="center"]
. Once it’s added, you still need to synchronize the Execution Environment from the registry. Select the *3 vertical dots* (vertical ellipsis), and select *Sync from registry*
+
image::./images/image10.png[titele="image10",500,float=".left.text-center",align="center"]
. You can monitor the status of the synchronization from the *Task Management* menu on the left
. Select the newly added Execution Environment and check it’s detail
+
image::./images/image28.png[titele="image28",500,float=".left.text-center",align="center"]
. Now, Let’s have the Automation Controller use this Execution Environment.  Select the *3 vertical dots* (vertical ellipsis), and select *Use in Controller*
+
image::./images/image10.png[titele="image10",500,float=".left.text-center",align="center"]
. You’ll be presented with a dialog.  You should see your controller name.  
+
image::./images/image24.png[titele="image24",500,float=".left.text-center",align="center"]
. Click on the controller name.  This will launch you to the *Automation Controller’s* Execution Environments UI
. Add the *Name*.  Make it the same: *another-azure-ee*
. *Pull Policy*:  Select “Only pull the image if not present before running”
. *Registry Credentials*:  Select “My Private Automation Hub” from the dropdown list
+
image::./images/image36.png[titele="image36",500,float=".left.text-center",align="center"]
. With this Execution Environment added to Automation Controller, you can if you wish adjust Projects or Job Templates to use this EE.  It will get pulled from the Private Automation Hub
